In fast-growing businesses, leaders often find themselves in familiar territory: a project that should have been completed months ago remains stalled. When the team is asked what happened, there is no shortage of explanations. The result is finger-pointing and frustration.

Before she starts working with Leadership Teams, Expert EOS Implementer Haraya Del Rosario Gust asks them to rate the level of accountability in their business. Responses rarely exceed the midpoint on a 10-point scale. When everyone is "responsible," no one truly is.

## The Accountability Problem

Conventional organizational charts list positions and reporting lines but rarely define who owns a function or outcome. An Accountability Chart differs fundamentally: it clearly shows who is accountable for what, defines each person's roles and responsibilities, and reveals any gaps in ownership.

EOS practitioners emphasize that accountability begins with structure. Instead of mapping positions around existing people, leaders first define the essential functions required to achieve the company's vision. Every business has core functions — sales and marketing, operations, and finance — in addition to leadership roles like the Integrator and Visionary.

## Building the Accountability Chart

Each seat represents a business function rather than a person. Leaders articulate around five key roles for each seat. For example, a sales seat might cover generating leads, managing the pipeline, closing deals, building brand awareness, and hitting revenue targets.

People are placed into seats using the **GWC test** — do they Get it, Want it, and have the Capacity to do it? This ensures individuals not only understand the job but are energized by it and have the skills to perform well. Only those who meet all three criteria are assigned to a seat.

## One Person, One Seat

A central discipline is that each function has just one owner. When more than one person is accountable, in reality, no one is. The person responsible may delegate tasks but owns the outcome.

Another key principle is to think in terms of functions, not titles. This helps organizations avoid building structures around current personalities, enabling easier adaptation as they grow.

## Beyond the Org Chart

The Accountability Chart provides company-wide visibility into everyone's role. It enhances communication, improves cross-department collaboration, helps identify capacity constraints, and increases transparency around goals. It isn't just a diagram — it is an operating guide for how work really gets done.

## Making It a Living Document

Effective Accountability Charts are dynamic. As the company evolves, leaders revisit the chart regularly — often quarterly — to adjust functions, roles, and assignments. This discipline ensures accountability evolves alongside growth.

## Crafting a Culture of Ownership

By defining functions, assigning ownership, and documenting expectations, the EOS Accountability Chart transforms accountability from an abstract ideal into everyday practice. It reduces finger-pointing, accelerates decision-making, and fosters a culture where commitments are honored.
