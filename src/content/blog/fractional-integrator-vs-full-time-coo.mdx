If your company is running on EOS with clearly defined visionary and integrator roles, you might be wondering about your next operational move. Should you hire a full-time COO or bring in a fractional integrator?

## The Core Difference

A **fractional integrator** is a part-time, EOS-trained operational leader who works 8 to 12 hours per week to implement systems, drive accountability, and strengthen your leadership team's execution.

A **full-time COO** is a senior executive who takes complete ownership of daily operations across your entire organization.

The key distinction isn't just time or cost — it's about what type of operational challenge you're solving.

## When You Need a Fractional Integrator

Fractional integrators work best when your core challenge is implementing or optimizing systems within the EOS framework. They bring specialized EOS expertise that most COOs lack, and can immediately improve your Level 10 meetings, ensure Rocks get completed, and build accountability structures.

The ideal scenario: you have a talented leadership team that struggles with operational discipline. A fractional integrator strengthens existing capabilities by installing better systems and processes.

## When You Need a Full-Time COO

Full-time COOs become necessary when your operational complexity outgrows what part-time attention can handle. Companies scaling past $25 million in revenue or managing 100+ people face a volume of daily operational decisions that require dedicated leadership.

Industry-specific expertise is another critical factor. Complex regulatory environments, intricate supply chains, or specialized operational processes need someone with deep domain knowledge available full-time.

## The Smart Progression

Many successful companies use a "train and transition" approach: start with a fractional integrator to build strong operational systems, then transition to a full-time COO when ready. This protects cash flow while building the operational foundation that makes eventual full-time hires more successful.

## Cost and Time Considerations

A fractional integrator typically costs **$3,000-$8,000 per month** for 8-12 hours of weekly engagement. A full-time COO requires **$120,000-$250,000 annually** plus benefits and equity.

More importantly, fractional integrators can deliver results within weeks because they focus on implementing proven systems. Full-time COOs typically need months to understand your business before contributing significantly.

## The Bottom Line

There's no universal answer. Fractional integrators excel at building systems, creating accountability, and strengthening existing teams. Full-time COOs excel at running complex operations and taking complete operational ownership. Understanding these differences helps you invest wisely.
