When a leading New Zealand technology company specializing in fleet management solutions decided to establish operations in the Philippines, they faced the classic challenge of international expansion: how to build a strong local presence while maintaining operational excellence and compliance standards.

The Philippines represented more than just a new market. It was a strategic move to build offshore capabilities that would drive long-term growth and operational resilience.

## The Expansion Challenge

Setting up operations in a new country involves navigating complex requirements across multiple fronts. The company needed to establish robust capabilities in engineering, administration, customer service, operations, and finance — all while ensuring compliance with local regulations and seamless integration with their New Zealand headquarters.

The key challenges included understanding Philippine labor laws, managing recruitment at speed and scale, maintaining compliance standards, and building effective cross-border team integration.

## Strategic Partnership Approach

Rather than going it alone, the company partnered with Satori through a comprehensive Master Services Agreement that combined two critical elements: fractional leadership expertise and comprehensive Employer of Record services.

### Employer of Record Foundation

At the core of the partnership, Satori's EOR services provided the legal and compliance foundation that made rapid expansion possible:

- Full HR compliance management with Philippine labor laws
- Complete employment contract administration
- Comprehensive benefits and payroll processing
- Ongoing regulatory compliance monitoring

### Fractional Leadership Excellence

Building on this compliance foundation, Satori deployed specialized fractional leaders:

1. **Fractional Finance Leadership** established connections with local partners to set up accounting systems, streamline payroll and tax processes, and handle legal registration and local banking relationships.

2. **Fractional People and Capability Leadership** worked closely with the company's existing HR team to develop a localized strategy, manage compliant recruitment and onboarding, and establish performance frameworks aligned with company standards.

3. **Fractional Integration Leadership** built crucial relationships between local and global teams, oversaw execution of key initiatives, and ensured strategic alignment across all operations — from office space acquisition to cultural integration.

## Results and Milestones

Since launching in November 2024, the partnership has delivered significant progress:

**Rapid Team Building**: More than 60 employees successfully hired and onboarded across both technical and customer support functions, with all hires meeting minimum five years' experience standards. This includes leaders who have taken on global roles within the organization.

**Operational Infrastructure**: Secured office space in Manila's Central Business District and established complete IT infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted operations from day one.

**Systems Implementation**: New HR and payroll systems deployed to enhance compliance efficiency and streamline processes.

**Process Optimization**: Comprehensive guidelines and standard operating procedures established to align procurement and setup processes with both headquarters requirements and local needs.

**Workplace Excellence**: Hot-desking policies, structured onboarding protocols, and performance monitoring systems implemented to support a seamless employee experience.

## Looking Forward

The partnership continues to evolve with focus on continued scaling, expanded implementation of EOS across all departments, advanced workforce planning and succession capabilities, and infrastructure expansion to support sustained long-term growth.

## Key Takeaways

This expansion demonstrates how the strategic combination of Employer of Record services and fractional leadership can transform international growth from a complex challenge into a competitive advantage. The EOR foundation provides compliance security and legal framework, while fractional leadership delivers the operational expertise needed for sustainable growth.

The success of this Philippine operation proves that with the right approach and partnerships, international expansion can deliver both immediate operational benefits and long-term strategic value.
