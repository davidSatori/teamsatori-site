        <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You know you need senior operational talent. Someone who can take ownership, drive execution, and free you
          from being the bottleneck. But a full-time C-suite hire is expensive, risky, and slow.

          Our fractional executives aren&rsquo;t advisors who drop in once a month with recommendations.
          They embed inside your team, attend your meetings, own your KPIs, and drive results &mdash;
          at a fraction of the cost and commitment of a full-time hire.
