        <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You&rsquo;ve done the offsite. You&rsquo;ve filled the whiteboard. Maybe you even hired a consultant who delivered a beautiful slide deck.
          But six months later, nothing changed.

        <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed">
          Strategy fails when it&rsquo;s disconnected from operations. When the team doesn&rsquo;t own it.
          When there&rsquo;s no bridge between &ldquo;where we want to go&rdquo; and &ldquo;what we do on Monday.&rdquo;
          We build that bridge.
