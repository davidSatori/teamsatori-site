        <h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-4xl mb-6">Growing Teams Without Growing Systems</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You went from 10 to 50 people, and suddenly everything that used to &ldquo;just work&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t anymore.
          Hiring takes too long. New hires don&rsquo;t ramp fast enough. Performance conversations don&rsquo;t happen.
          Good people leave because they don&rsquo;t see a path forward.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed">
          Most founder-led companies underinvest in people systems because the founder &ldquo;just handled it.&rdquo;
          But at scale, you need infrastructure &mdash; not more founders.
